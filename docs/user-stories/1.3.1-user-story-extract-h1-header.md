### 1.3.1 - Extract the first H1 header (skipping frontmatter) to use as the new filename so that the filename matches the document title

#### Parent: 1.3 - Generate new filenames based on the H1 header or fallback to the original filename

* **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
    ```gherkin
    Given a markdown file with frontmatter and an H1 header
    When the script processes the file
    Then it skips the frontmatter and uses the first H1 header as the filename base.

    Given a markdown file without an H1 header
    When the script processes the file
    Then it uses the original filename (without extension) as the filename base.
    ```
