### 1.5.3 - Prompt to resolve filename conflicts (overwrite, append a number, or skip)

#### Parent: 1.5 - Handle file extensions and conflicts

* **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
    ```gherkin
    Given a filename conflict occurs
    When the script detects the conflict
    Then I am prompted to choose to overwrite, append a number, or skip.

    Given I choose to append a number
    When the script renames the file
    Then it finds the next available numbered filename and uses it.
    ```
