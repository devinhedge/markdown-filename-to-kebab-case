# 1.3 - Generate new filenames based on the H1 header or fallback to the original filename

## DESCRIPTION: As a user, I want the script to generate new filenames based on the H1 header or fallback to the original filename so that filenames are meaningful.

## Acceptance Criteria:
User Experience Focus:
* **Pain/Frustration Solved/Opportunity Enabled:** Ensures filenames reflect document content, not just arbitrary names.
* **Key User Experience Goals:** Accurate extraction of H1 headers, reliable fallback, and clear messaging.
* **User Behavior/Outcome:** Users see filenames that match document titles or original names if no title exists.
