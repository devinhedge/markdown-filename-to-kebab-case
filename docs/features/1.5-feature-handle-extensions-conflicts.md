# 1.5 - Handle file extensions and conflicts

## DESCRIPTION: As a user, I want the script to handle file extensions and conflicts so that the process is robust and idempotent.

## Acceptance Criteria:
User Experience Focus:
* **Pain/Frustration Solved/Opportunity Enabled:** Prevents extension confusion and accidental overwrites.
* **Key User Experience Goals:** Extensions are standardized, conflicts are resolved interactively, and files are not renamed unnecessarily.
* **User Behavior/Outcome:** Users see correct extensions, are prompted on conflicts, and can safely rerun the script.
