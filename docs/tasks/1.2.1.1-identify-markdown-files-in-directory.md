Implement the logic to identify all markdown files in a directory for processing. The script should:

- List all files in the specified directory.
- Filter and include only files with .md, .markdown, or .mmd extensions.
- Exclude files with unsupported extensions.
- Ensure the code is modular, testable, and follows the guidance in "Prompt - Python Code Generation Prompt Guidance.md".
