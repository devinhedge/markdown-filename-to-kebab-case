task: Run and verify passing test for kebab-case conversion
parent_user_story: "1.4.3 - The filename is converted to kebab-case so that it is consistent and easy to use"
expected_outcome: "All kebab-case conversion tests pass, confirming correct implementation"
task_steps:
  - Run the test suite after implementing the function
  - Confirm all positive and negative test cases pass
  - Review code coverage and add additional tests if needed
---

After implementing the kebab-case conversion function, run the test suite to verify all tests pass. Ensure both positive and negative cases are covered. Add additional tests for edge cases if necessary. Follow the guidance in "Prompt - Python Code Generation Prompt Guidance.md".
