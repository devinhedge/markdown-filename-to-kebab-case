task: Extract H1 header or fallback to filename
parent_user_story: "1.3.1 - Extract the first H1 header (skipping frontmatter) to use as the new filename so that the filename matches the document title"
expected_outcome: "The script uses the first H1 header after frontmatter as the filename base, or falls back to the original filename if no H1 is found"
task_steps:
  - Open each markdown file and skip any frontmatter
  - Search for the first line starting with '# ' after frontmatter
  - If found, use the text as the filename base
  - If not found, use the original filename (without extension) as the base

Write Python code to extract the first H1 header from a markdown file, skipping any frontmatter. If no H1 header is found, use the original filename (without extension) as the base for renaming. Ensure the code is modular, robust, and follows the guidance in "Prompt - Python Code Generation Prompt Guidance.md".
