task: Handle directory path prompt and validation
parent_user_story: "1.1.1 - Provide a directory path (via command-line or prompt) so that the script can process my markdown files"
expected_outcome: "User can enter a path or type 'quit' to exit; invalid paths prompt for re-entry or quit; valid paths prompt for confirmation"
task_steps:
  - Prompt the user for a directory path if not provided as a command-line argument
  - If the user enters 'quit', exit the program
  - If the path is invalid or not a directory, inform the user and prompt to re-enter or quit
  - If the path is valid, prompt the user to confirm, reject, or quit before processing begins

You are to implement the logic for handling user input for the target directory path in a Python script that renames markdown files. Follow these requirements:

- Prompt the user for a directory path if not provided as a command-line argument.
- If the user enters 'quit', the script should exit gracefully.
- If the path is invalid or not a directory, inform the user and prompt to re-enter or quit.
- If the path is valid, prompt the user to confirm, reject, or quit before processing begins.
- Ensure the code is modular, class-based, and follows the guidance in "Prompt - Python Code Generation Prompt Guidance.md".
- Write code that is testable and robust, with clear error handling and user feedback.
