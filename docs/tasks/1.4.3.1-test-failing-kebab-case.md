task: Write failing test for kebab-case conversion
parent_user_story: "1.4.3 - The filename is converted to kebab-case so that it is consistent and easy to use"
expected_outcome: "A test is written that fails because the kebab-case conversion function is not yet implemented or correct"
task_steps:
  - Define test cases for converting strings to kebab-case (positive and negative cases)
  - Implement the test in the test suite
  - Run the test and confirm it fails
---

Write a Python unit test for the kebab-case conversion function. The test should cover:
- Lowercasing
- Replacing spaces, underscores, and non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens
- Collapsing multiple hyphens
- Trimming leading/trailing hyphens
- Edge cases (empty string, already kebab-case, strings with only invalid characters)

Follow the guidance in "Prompt - Python Code Generation Prompt Guidance.md". Ensure the test fails before the function is implemented.
